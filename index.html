            <p>As we all know, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best soccer players in the world, but some don't know much besides that. Here are some fun facts about CR7: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CR7 got his name, "Ronaldo", because his favorite actor's name so happened to be U.S president, Ronald Reagan.</li>
                <li>He is the youngest child in his family.</li>
                <li>Cristiano Ronaldo actually grew up poor and had to share a bedroom with his older siblings.</li>
                <li>When he was 8 years old, he played for an amateur team named "Andorinha", and his father was the actual coach of that team.</li>
                <li>His nickname was "cry-baby" as a child.</li>
                <li>14 year old Ronaldo was a pretty popular student in his school, but he was expelled for throwing a chair at a teacher. He says that the teacher disrespected him and since that incident, his mother told him to focus on football (soccer), so he did and just look at where he is now. Rookie mistake, "teacher"...  </li>
                <li>As a teenager, Ronaldo would practice with ankle weights and dribble the ball that way. He thought that if he trained with them, then he would be a lot faster without them when he's on the pitch, which is rather smart of him.</li>
                <li>Manchester United gave Ronaldo a twelve million euro worth contract in 2003, which is a record fee for a young player like him. </li>
                <li>Ronaldo is a committed Roman Catholic.</li>
                <li>He will sprint 900 times more than an Olympic sprinter in a single season.</li>
            </ul>
